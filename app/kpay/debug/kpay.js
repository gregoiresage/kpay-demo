  BEWARE: this function can return the wrong result in the situation that a user deleted the app AFTER having purchased it, then later reinstalls the app. 
  In that case the library "thinks" this is a clean install and will NOT return the status "licensed" until there was communication with the 
  kpay server and it received the licensed status from the kpay server (should not be more then a few seconds after installation). 
  Keep this in mind when showing messages to the user based on the result of this function.
